**Docuverify** is a powerful **plagiarism and AI content detection platform** built to help users manage and analyze documents with precision and ease.


## 🔍 Project Description

Docuverify automates critical document-related workflows such as:

* 📑 Document version tracking
* 📊 Generating detailed analysis reports
* 🚨 Sending alerts and notifications on analysis results

Users can **submit documents** to supervisors for analysis, and the platform provides:

* 📧 Email feedback to students with detailed insights on **potential plagiarism** or **AI-generated content**
* 🔄 Integration with existing **document management systems** for smooth workflows

## 🧪 Algorithms & Models

### 📈 TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)

A statistical technique used to:

* Identify **key terms and phrases** in documents
* Detect **unique or unusual wording** that may suggest **plagiarism** or **AI content**

TF-IDF compares term frequency in a single document versus across a larger corpus, allowing Docuverify to detect suspicious or standout text.

### 🤖 RoBERTa (Transformer Model)

Docuverify uses **RoBERTa**, a transformer-based language model, for:

* Advanced **text classification**
* Semantic **content analysis**
* Improving **AI-generated content detection** with high accuracy

## 🚀 Approach

The platform was architected with:

* **Robust APIs** using Django + DRF
* **Responsive UI** with React + TypeScript
* **Machine Learning Integration** with TFIDF & RoBERTa models

Together, these tools enable users to **analyze documents**, **receive automated insights**, and **ensure academic integrity**.
